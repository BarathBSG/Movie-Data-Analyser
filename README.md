I wrote this program as part of a submission to analyse data given in a text file (movies.txt).

The program reads the file and parses every line, using string manipulation and regex to make an object out of every line with the movie title and its info.

This is printed to the console by functions in certain orders, with functions to obtain highs and lows of data types.

I have already used some of the functions I wrote in Main.java, and I made an attempt at using test harnesses.
